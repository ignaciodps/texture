After these day 10 days, I feel more confident and knowledgeable in networkinhg. I reviewed many of the things I had covered in the past while also learning things I had never seen before. While I could spend months on networking, I think it is better to shift my focus to Python. At this point in my career, I have spent a few hundred hours coding and have already learned the basics of Python. However, I would like to learn more applications for scripting and feel comfortable in that domain. I will be taking the "Python 3 For Offensive PenTest: A Complete Practical Course" course on Udemy by Hussam Khrais
